        p Hello! #[img(src="/img/outwith-logo-horizontal.svg", alt="Outwith", title="outwith", style="width: 8rem; margin: 0; transform: translateY(2px);")] is me, #[span.highlighted Alan Nevens], doing photography in Edinburgh. I particularly like taking pictures of people and of books (which are like people but better and more rectangular). 
        p And I particularly like working with people in the arts and charity sectors. 
        p If you want to discuss working with me, please email me at #[a.highlighted(href="mailto:alan@outwith.work") alan@outwith.work].
