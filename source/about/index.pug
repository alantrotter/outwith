        p Hello! #[span(style="font-weight: 800; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 0.1em; font-size: 16px;") Outwith] is me, #[span.highlighted Alan Nevens], doing photography in Edinburgh. I am particularly keen to work with people in the arts and charity sectors, and particularly like taking pictures of people and of books (which are like people but better and more rectangular).
        p If you want to discuss working with me, please email me at #[a.highlighted(href="mailto:alan@outwith.work") alan@outwith.work].
